Advisory #10A on Major Hurricane WANDA
155MPH     926MB
13.9N      98.4W
Movement NNW at 21mph

STATUS
At 18:00 UTC ... 12:00 FDT ... Major Hurricane Wanda was located 380 miles east of Port Foy, Foy Province, and 
is maintaining intensity whilst battling dry air intrusion. Wanda currently has peak wind speeds of 155mph, and a
pressure of 926mb. Forward motion has increased to 21mph, keeping the storm's possibility of attaining Category 5 
status alive as a more moist environment lies to the north. Wind shear remains near zero, and is not expected to
increase for some time.

WARNINGS
No warnings are in effect for land areas, however the storm is now generating rough surf between Port Foy and
Rushden Point. All beaches in the area are closed. Rough sea conditions are expected to begin further north in the
next day or two.

FORECAST
Forecast models still have the storm fairly close to the east coast of the Fool's Republic, and storm conditions 
are a possibility for this region. However, hurricane conditions are still not expected here. Those living anywhere
between Rushden Point and Cape Wrath, including islands, should stay tuned for future updates and advice from your 
local National Weather Service office.
