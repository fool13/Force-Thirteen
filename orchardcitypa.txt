Movement NW at 2mph

STATUS
At 00:00 UTC ... 18:00 FDT ... Tropical Depression Fourteen was located 480 miles east-southeast of Port Foy,
Foy Province, and is expected to quickly intensify over the next few days, owing to incredibly conducive
atmospheric conditions. We have high confidence on the likelihood of this cyclone reaching hurricane status in
the next five days. The storm is currently nearly stationary and is expected to gradually speed up in forward
motion towards the northwest.

WARNINGS
No warnings are in effect for land areas

FORECAST
The storm is likely to gradually move towards the northwest and could threaten the east coast of Fool's Country
in the next five days, though it is more likely that the storm will harmlessly recurve out to sea without 
significantly affecting land.
