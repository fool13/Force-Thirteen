Movement W at 1mph

STATUS
At 00:00 UTC ... 18:00 FDT ... Tropical Depression Nine-G was located 690 miles east-southeast of Port Foy, Foy
Province, and is expected to remain nearly stationary in the next 24 hours. No land areas are currently experience
adverse conditions related to the storm.

FORECAST
The depression is likely to continue to stall in the area and draw slightly towards the west in the next 24 hours,
before quicker movement towards the north or north-west. It is possible that TD 09-G will dissipate within the next
48 hours due to dry air entrainment, but there is a chance that the storm will survive this and possibly
reintensify or regenerate on Tuesday.
