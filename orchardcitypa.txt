130MPH     949MB
11.1N      97.4W
Movement NW at 12mph

STATUS
At 12:00 UTC ... 06:00 FDT ... Major Hurricane Wanda was located 420 miles east-southeast of Port Foy,
Foy Province, and is continuing to rapidly intensify due to very good conditions around the storm which is likely to
remain for some time, opening up the possibility of Wanda becoming the first ever Category 5 recorded in the area.
Wind shear is near nil, water vapour is high but decreasing, ocean heat content remains high, Sea Surface Temperatures
are high and have risen since yesterday.
A Hurricane Hunter mission will be sent into Wanda later today.

WARNINGS
No warnings are in effect for land areas, however the storm is likely to generate rough surf along the eastern
coast of Fool's Republic.

FORECAST
Forecast models still have the storm fairly close to the east coast of the Fool's Republic, and storm conditions 
are a possibility for this region. However, hurricane conditions are still not expected here. Those living anywhere
between Rushden Point and Cape Wrath, including islands, should stay tuned for future updates and advice from your 
local National Weather Service office.
