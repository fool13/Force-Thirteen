165MPH     917MB
14.5N      98.6W
Movement NNW at 15mph

STATUS
At 00:00 UTC ... 18:00 FDT ... Major Hurricane Wanda was located 380 miles east of Port Foy, Foy Province, and 
is rapidly intensifying once again. Wanda has sustained winds of 165mph ... 265km/h, with a central air pressure of
917mb ... 27.08inHg. Dry air remains present to the northwest of the storm, and Wanda is still battling to keep this
away from the storm's center.

WARNINGS
No warnings are in effect for land areas, however the storm is now generating rough surf between Port Foy and
Rushden Point. All beaches in the area are closed. Rough sea conditions are expected to begin further north in the
next day or two.

FORECAST
Forecast models still have the storm fairly close to the east coast of the Fool's Republic, and storm conditions 
are a possibility for this region. However, hurricane conditions are still not expected here. Those living anywhere
between Rushden Point and Cape Wrath, including islands, should stay tuned for future updates and advice from your 
local National Weather Service office.
