Advisory #9A on Major Hurricane WANDA
145MPH     936MB
12.4N      98.0W
Movement NW at 15mph

STATUS
At 06:00 UTC ... 00:00 FDT ... Major Hurricane Wanda was located 390 miles east of Port Foy, Foy Province, and 
has stopped intensifying due to an eyewall replacement cycle. This process is expected to be completed within a
matter of hours, and the weakening trend is expected to be short lived before a resumption of intensification and
a probable Category 5 peak in the next 48 hours.

WARNINGS
No warnings are in effect for land areas, however the storm is now generating rough surf between Port Foy and
Rushden Point. All beaches in the area are closed. Rough sea conditions are expected to begin further north in the
next day or two.

FORECAST
Forecast models still have the storm fairly close to the east coast of the Fool's Republic, and storm conditions 
are a possibility for this region. However, hurricane conditions are still not expected here. Those living anywhere
between Rushden Point and Cape Wrath, including islands, should stay tuned for future updates and advice from your 
local National Weather Service office.
