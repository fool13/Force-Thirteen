ORCHARD CITY STORM WARNING CENTRE
-------------------------------------------
STORM DISCUSSION - 26 JUL 2015   21:00 UTC
-------------------------------------------
At 21:00 UTC ... 15:00 FDT, there is one active tropical cyclone in the Orchard City AOR or in the Northwestern 
Fool's Ocean (extending to 30 degrees west and 0 degrees north).
Tropical Storm TIFFANY (998mb) is currently located at 16.0 degrees north, 77.4 degrees west, or 1080 miles 
east of Rushden Point, Orchard Province. The storm is currently moving west at 5mph. Satellite imagery 
indicates that the storm is quickly developing despite high windshear around its northern and western fringes,
and is displaying no signs of slowdown with its intensification.
Computer models are anticipating Tiffany to become a hurricane in the next three days, however, with its current
burst of intensification, this could occur much sooner. Extended forecasts show the storm moving towards Fool
Province, and so far it is unclear whether Tiffany will recurve before reaching the coast.

Next update at 21:00 FDT
