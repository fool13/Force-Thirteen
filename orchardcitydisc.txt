ORCHARD CITY STORM WARNING CENTRE
-------------------------------------------
STORM DISCUSSION - 18 JUL 2015   23:00 UTC
-------------------------------------------
At 23:00 UTC ... 17:00 FDT, there is one active tropical cyclone in the Orchard City AOR or in the Northwestern 
Fool's Ocean (extending to 30 degrees west and 0 degrees north).
Tropical Depression Eight-G (1003mb) is currently located at 6.8 degrees north, 93.5 degrees west, or 690 miles 
east-southeast of Port Foy, Foy Province. The depression is currently nearly stationary. Satellite imagery 
indicates that the depression is struggling with dry air entrainment, and is in danger of dissipating entirely 
within a matter of hours.
Computer models are still unsure on whether this system will attain tropical storm status or not, but the latest
developments show that this system is unlikely to bounce back from an increasing amount of dry air supremecy.
