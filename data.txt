This file is to be used to display data for every storm in the following categories:
1. Storm intensity in KNOTS and HECTOPASCALS/MILLIBARS
2. Storm location in LATITUDE (vertical axis) and LONGITUDE (horizontal axis)
3. Storm movement direction and speed (e.g. W at 20kts)
4A. Forward motion speed and direction change since the last update
4B. Expected forward motion change in 24 hours' time
5A. SST change since the last update
5B. Expected SST change in 24 hours' time
6A. Water Vapour (WV) change since the last update
6B. Expected WV change in 24 hours
6C. Expected WV change in 72 hours
7. Windshear change since the last update
All of these factors should help RSMCs to forecast the storms. We also have an experimental feature 
which attempts to plot the storm's future direction, but it is untested and unproven at this time.
8. Expected Direction Change days 1-5

INSTRUCTIONS FOR RSMCs
If you are actively forecasting and observing the storm for yourself, please fill out the data related to your storm below
You must input this new data up to 5 minutes before the next ATCF update (00Z, 06Z, 12Z, 18Z). Any values that aren't
changed before the ATCF update will be filled by the Master Computer.
